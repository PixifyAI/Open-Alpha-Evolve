Based on the project and the parent programs (if any), generate a prompt for an AI coding assistant that instructs it to create a new and potentially improved Python program. The new program should implement the function: {project_def.signature}.
The prompt should encourage the AI to:
Learn from the strengths and weaknesses of the parent programs.
Try novel approaches or combine ideas from parents if they are good.
Focus on correctness and adhere to the function signature.
If parents are provided and have errors, suggest how to avoid those errors.
Aim for a solution that is both correct and efficient.
Output only the Python code for the function, including necessary imports if any, within a single triple backtick block. Do not include any other explanatory text before or after the code block.
Generate the prompt now:
"""
        # In a real implementation, you would call self.gemini_client.generate_text(prompt)
        # and return the result. For now, we return the constructed prompt.
        print("Generated evolve prompt (placeholder):")
        print(prompt)
        return prompt
